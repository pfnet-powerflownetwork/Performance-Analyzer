# PFNET Performance Analyzer

The **Performance Analyzer** is an integral component of the **Power Flow Network (PFNET)** ecosystem, designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize the computational performance of nodes within the distributed network. This repository is essential for ensuring efficient task distribution and high availability in PFNET, ultimately maximizing the network's utility and reliability.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously track CPU and memory usage across all nodes in the PFNET.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Utilize the `PerformanceAnalyzer` and `OptimizationEngine` to identify bottlenecks, underutilized nodes, and inefficiencies.
- **Dynamic Optimization:** Redistribute workloads based on real-time performance metrics to maintain optimal network performance.
- **Visual Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface (`PerformanceDashboard.js`) to visualize node performance and initiate manual optimizations.

## Role in PFNET

The **Performance Analyzer** plays a crucial role in PFNET by:

- **Ensuring Fair Utilization:** Balancing workloads across participating nodes to prevent overloading.
- **Improving Throughput:** Dynamically redistributing tasks to underutilized nodes for better efficiency.
- **Providing Insights:** Delivering actionable insights to the PFNET agent for decision-making and long-term planning.
- **Facilitating Scalability:** Supporting the seamless addition of new nodes to the network by dynamically integrating them into the workflow.

## Core Components

### 1. **NodePerformanceMonitor.java**
Responsible for real-time tracking of CPU and memory usage across all PFNET nodes.

```java
public class NodePerformanceMonitor {
    public PerformanceMetrics collectMetrics(String nodeId) {
        // Collect and return performance data for the specified node
    }
}
```

### 2. **PerformanceAnalyzer.java**
Analyzes metrics collected from nodes and identifies areas for improvement.

```java
public class PerformanceAnalyzer {
    public List<NodeOptimization> analyzeMetrics(List<PerformanceMetrics> metrics) {
        // Analyze and return optimization recommendations
    }
}
```

### 3. **OptimizationEngine.java**
Implements strategies to optimize task distribution across PFNET nodes.

```java
public class OptimizationEngine {
    public void redistributeTasks(List<NodeOptimization> optimizations) {
        // Redistribute tasks based on analysis
    }
}
```

### 4. **PerformanceDashboard.js**
Provides a visual representation of network performance and optimization actions.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    fetchPerformanceData().then(data => renderPerformanceMetrics(data));
});
```

### 5. **PerformanceConfig.properties**
Configuration file for thresholds, intervals, and alert settings.

```properties
cpuHighThreshold=80.0
monitoringInterval=60
optimizationInterval=300
```
